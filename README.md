Using a computational film studies framework, this article examines a major
Swedish newsreel archive—the Journal Digital collection—deploying among others:
signal
archaeology, named entity recognition, and geocoding. We also apply a broad
algorithmic toolbox to convert both intertitles and speech 
into a transcribed and timestamped corpus of the entire collection. Our basic
idea is to construct a number of mid-sized datasets from the Journal Digital
collection in different modalities, and proceed with an examination using
various approaches. Consequently, our intention is to increase the scholarly
capacity of media historical sources, while at the same time critically
scrutinising AI and algorithmic toolboxes for the multimodal study of the past.
